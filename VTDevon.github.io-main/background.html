          EventSphere is an online event management and ticketing platform
          designed to serve both event organizers and attendees effectively.
          This platform facilitates seamless organization, ticketing, and
          management of events, offering a comprehensive solution tailored to
          these core users. Organizers can create and manage events, track
          ticket sales in real time, offer merchandise, and facilitate in-app
          food and drink sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          For attendees, EventSphere provides an integrated experience from
          ticket purchase to event participation. Users can buy tickets,
          pre-order items, and utilize a unique QR code to check in and collect
          their pre-ordered merchandise or concessions. Vendors, forming a
          subcomponent for organizers, have easy access to attendee orders,
          fulfilling them through QR scans and real-time inventory updates, thus
          ensuring efficient service.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform operates on a microservices architecture to support
          scalability and real-time updates across essential services, including
          event management, ticketing, order processing, and vendor management.
          Core services include a ticketing service for QR code generation and
          attendee check-ins, an order management service for merchandise and
          food handling, and an analytics service that offers organizers
          post-event insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this design, EventSphere aims to transform event management by
          providing a streamlined online platform for organizers and attendees
          alike.
