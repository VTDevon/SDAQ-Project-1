        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
        <!-- Modify per page -->
        <p>
          The design of EventSphere aims to deliver a comprehensive, modular, and scalable event management platform that meets the diverse needs of organizers, attendees, and vendors. This system integrates various services such as ticketing, payment processing, order management, real-time vendor coordination, and analytics into a seamless experience. EventSphere leverages event-driven architecture to maintain responsiveness during high-demand scenarios, ensuring smooth operations across multiple services.
          The platform is structured to support high availability, secure transactions, and real-time updates, essential for large-scale events with fluctuating traffic and operational demands. By adopting a layered architecture and domain-driven design (DDD), the system ensures that each function, from ticket generation to post-event reporting, operates independently but cohesively. These design decisions promote maintainability and flexibility, allowing for easy enhancements and future scalability.
          This design rationale outlines the key functions of EventSphere, explains the design decisions made for each function, and provides a justification for how these decisions align with the systemâ€™s functional and non-functional requirements. From managing ticket lifecycles with QR codes to enabling real-time vendor management and providing actionable analytics, the system is built to offer a robust and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.
          
        </p>

        <h3> Function 1: Ticket Management and QR Code Generation</h3>
        <p> The Ticketing Module (DE-3) manages the entire lifecycle of tickets by employing the State Machine pattern to transition tickets between states such as "Available," "Reserved," "Sold," and "Checked-In." Upon successful ticket purchase, the system generates a unique QR code (DE-6) that consolidates ticket and merchandise information. If attendees make additional purchases or cancel their orders, the QR code is updated dynamically to reflect these changes in real time, ensuring accuracy and consistency (FR-6, FR-11). At the event entrance, the QR code enables quick check-ins, simplifying attendee entry and minimizing delays (FR-7).

          The State Machine pattern (DE-3) ensures that the system tracks each ticket's state accurately throughout its lifecycle. Meanwhile, the QR Code Module (DE-6) streamlines operations by embedding all relevant order information into a single code, reducing the need for multiple documents and enhancing the attendee experience.<p>
        <h3> Function 2: Event Management and Capacity Tracking </h3>
        <p> The Event Management Module (DE-2) allows organizers to create and manage events using an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to capture complex relationships between events, venues, and vendors. The system provides real-time updates on ticket availability and remaining capacity, helping organizers maintain control over event attendance (FR-2). Additionally, the integration with the Vendor Management Module (DE-4) allows organizers to offer merchandise and concessions through the platform, providing a unified experience for attendees (FR-3). Event data flows into the Analytics Module (DE-8), giving organizers insights into ticket sales and event performance, which are critical for planning future events (FR-12, FR-13).

          The ER model (DE-2) efficiently structures relationships between key entities, ensuring seamless data management. Integration with vendor and analytics modules ensures that the event management function operates cohesively within the broader system, empowering organizers to make informed decisions in real time.</p>
        <h3> Function 3: Secure Payment Processing and Order Management </h3>
        <p> The Payment Processing Module (DE-5) ensures secure transactions by using the Strategy Pattern to provide flexibility in payment options, including credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. Payment processing is isolated within the Payment Gateway Interface to ensure that all transactions comply with PCI DSS standards (FR-10). If attendees make changes to their orders or request cancellations, the system regenerates the QR code (DE-6) to reflect the new information instantly (FR-11). Additionally, the Refund Manager in the ticketing system ensures that refunds are processed promptly, updating ticket availability in real time (DE-3, FR-10).

          By using the Strategy Pattern (DE-5), the system provides attendees with flexible payment options and ensures secure, compliant transactions. Integration with the QR Code Module (DE-6) keeps order information up-to-date, reducing the risk of confusion during event check-ins.</p>
        <h3> Function 4: Vendor Management and Inventory Tracking </h3>
        <p> The Vendor Management Module (DE-4) enables vendors to manage orders and inventory efficiently through a Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) architecture. This architecture sends real-time notifications to vendors whenever new orders are placed, allowing them to prepare orders promptly. Attendees can collect their orders by scanning QR codes (DE-6), providing a fast and reliable order fulfillment process (FR-8). To prevent overselling, the system tracks inventory levels in real time, displaying current stock availability to attendees (FR-9). Vendor performance data flows into the Analytics Module (DE-8) to provide post-event insights, helping organizers optimize future events (FR-12, FR-13).

          The Pub/Sub model (DE-4) ensures seamless communication between vendors and the platform, enabling quick responses to new orders. Integration with the QR Code Module (DE-6) ensures that order retrieval is fast and accurate, enhancing the attendee experience.</p>
        <h3> Function 5: Post-Event Analytics and Reporting </h3>
        <p> The Analytics and Reporting Module (DE-8) aggregates data from multiple sources using a Data Warehouse architecture, ensuring that ticket sales, attendance, and vendor performance data are analyzed efficiently. During events, organizers can monitor real-time metrics through the Analytics Dashboard (FR-12). After the event, detailed reports are generated, offering insights into event success and areas for improvement (FR-13). Organizers can also export these reports to assist in planning future events and optimizing vendor selections.

          The Data Warehouse architecture (DE-8) ensures that the platform handles large datasets effectively, providing actionable insights. Real-time and post-event analytics help organizers make data-driven decisions, enhancing event planning and execution.</p>
