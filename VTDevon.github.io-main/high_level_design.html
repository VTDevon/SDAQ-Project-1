        <!-- Abstract Design Style -->
        <p>
          After careful consideration of design architectures, the most
          promising impact was found to be of the Abstract Design Style in order
          to give a high level functionality overview of the EventSphere system.
          The focus is primarily on creating a modular, user-centered, and
          event-driven architecture with clear domain boundaries, security, and
          resilience for this event management system. Based on the requirements
          and use cases of EventSphere, the high level system architecture would
          adhere to the following aspects to satisfy the abstract design
          paradigm.
        </p>

        <!-- Layered Modular Approach -->
        <h3>1. Layered Modular Approach</h3>
        <h4>Presentation Layer</h4>
        <p>
          This layer essentially manages user interfaces for both organizers and
          attendees, providing interaction points for booking events, managing
          sales, and vendor interactions. This layer focuses on delivering a
          cohesive, responsive user experience across devices.
        </p>
        <h4>Business Logic Layer</h4>
        <p>
          This layer would encapsulate core functionalities, such as ticketing,
          event management, and payment processing. Each business function is
          modularized, ensuring that each module can be independently developed,
          maintained, and scaled if needed.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Access Layer</h4>
        <p>
          Handles all interactions with storage systems, while also abstracting
          data access and retrieval for entities like users, events, orders, and
          inventory. Due to its abstraction, it would support various storage
          types (NoSQL, SQL etc.) as necessary for each independent service.

        <!-- Domain Driven Design -->
        <h3>2. Domain-Driven Design</h3>
        <p>
          In order to ensure the systemâ€™s architecture aligns closely with
          real-world event management concepts, clear and well-defined domains
          or services for each business function are listed as follows:
        </p>

        <h4>User Management</h4>
        <p>
          This service essentially focuses on user authentication, profile
          management, and user roles (e.g., attendees, organizers, vendors). It
          corresponds to the Event Creation component as mentioned in Figure 1.
        </p>
        <h4>Event Management</h4>
        <p>
          This service manages all event-related data, including event details,
          ticket availability, venue scheduling, and prices. The organizer would
          be the one interacting with this service in order to ascertain the
          above mentioned functionalities.
        </p>
        <h4>Order and Payment Processing</h4>
        <p>
          It handles orders for tickets, merchandise, and concessions, as well
          as processing payments securely and integrating with third-party
          payment providers. It incorporates the ticketing system that the
          attendee would interact with in order to book tickets to the event.
        </p>
        <h4>Vendor and Inventory Management</h4>
        <p>
          This service controls vendor data, concession and merchandise
          inventory, and order fulfillment processes, ensuring each vendor
          operates independently yet in sync with the event flow. The inventory
          data visibility is extended to the organizers, attendees, and the
          vendors.
        </p>
        <h4>Analytics and Reporting</h4>
        <p>
          This domain would essentially be data driven based on the other
          services and provide an analytics/visualization dashboard to the
          organizer to determine real time inventory/sales data flow and post
          event metrics.
        </p>
        <div
          style="
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            margin-top: 0.5rem;
            margin-bottom: 1rem;
          "
        >
          <img class="image" src="/images/DomainDesign.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div
          style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 1rem"
        >
          <pre> <i>Figure 3 - Domains of EventSphere </i></pre>
        </div>

        <!-- Event-Driven System -->
        <h3>3. Event-Driven System</h3>
        <p>
          A system such as the EventSphere, will undergo spikes in terms of
          event traffic, server requests and communications. In order to
          effectively ensure system responsiveness and resilience under these
          conditions, the underlying services would need to be decoupled by
          enabling asynchronous communication through events. Some guidelines
          that would be adhered to are as follows:
        </p>
        <h4>Event Notification</h4>
        <p>
          Key actions, such as "Ticket Purchased," "Order Placed," and "Vendor
          Stock Updated," trigger events published to a centralized event bus in
          order to allow services to respond in real time to system events
          without being tightly coupled.
        </p>
        <h4>Reactive Event Listeners</h4>
        <p>
          Each service listens only to the events relevant to its
          responsibilities. For example, the analytics service listens for
          events like ticket purchases and orders to update statistics, while
          the vendor service listens for order fulfillment requests.
        </p>
        <h4>Logging Service</h4>
        <p>
          Use events for tracking critical actions (e.g., purchases, check-ins)
          for security, audit purposes, and troubleshooting with all relevant
          events stored in an event store or log system which can be directed to
          a cloud storage such as AWS S3.
        </p>

        <!-- Security Design -->
        <h3>4. Security Design</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important aspects to consider when implementing this
          system would be to ensure that EventSphere is a secure system that
          protects user data, transaction integrity, and privacy. Some
          guidelines to consider are as follows:
        </p>
        <h4>Authentication and Authorization</h4>
        <p>
          Utilize access control based on assigned roles (organizer, attendee,
          vendors) in order to manage permissions for attendees, organizers, and
          vendors, ensuring each user role has appropriate access to resources
          (Auth0, etc.).
        </p>
        <h4>Secure Payment Gateway Integration</h4>
        <p>Isolate payment processing within the payment service.</p>
        <h4>Data Encryption and Protection</h4>
        <p>
          Secure sensitive data (like payment details and personal information)
          through encryption in transit and at rest, in order to safeguard data
          in all layers and components.
        </p>

        <!-- Scalability & Resilience -->
        <h3>5. Scalability & Resilience</h3>
        <p>
          Implement functionalities such as load balancing across services and
          auto scaling to ensure the system can handle varying levels of traffic
          and provide consistent performance.
